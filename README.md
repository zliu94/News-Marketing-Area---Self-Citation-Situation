## Research the situation of self-citation in news marketing area
##### Introduction and Background
In the past 15 years, with the rapid development of the Internet and social networking websites, the news media has developed a new way of publishing news. It has led to a variety of different marketing methods, for example, relying on social media such as Facebook and Twitter to publish news and breaking information. Also, they rely on different user profiles such as gender, age, region, and interests to reach different readers and push articles and ads which the users like. As a result, there are many new publications different from previous studies discuss issues related to news marketing.

##### Question and Result
In this project, I want to know about the publications on this topic in the news marketing in the past few years, such as the region, year, title, high citation authors, and connections between authors. For the author's self-citation status, find out the authors who have high self-citation or high mutual citations, analyze their subject title, publish year and area.
The result of this project, I found out:
* The publications about “News marketing” publish increase significant from 2005, and high cited publications publish densely between 2009 to 2019.
* High cited publication and the publication citing them
* Different year, the keywords of title will be different.
* USA is the highest cited country.
* There are 15 groups of the authors networks
* Some authors have higher self-cited publications

##### Resource and Analysis Methodology
The data source is from Web of Science, which contains high-cited publications related to "News marketing" and the publications, regions, years, and authors who cite them. 
I use python to do EDA analyze, and make the text mining of the title. Moreover, I use Gephi to do the network analysis, and Tableau & Excel to visualize.
